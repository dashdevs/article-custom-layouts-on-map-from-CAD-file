In order to use Google Maps SDK you need to setup Google Maps Platform. If you do not already have a Google Cloud Platform account and a project with billing enabled, please see the Getting Started with Google Maps Platform guide to create a billing account and a project.
In the Cloud Console, click the project drop-down menu and select the project that you want.
Enable the Google Maps Platform APIs and SDKs required for this codelab in the Google Cloud Marketplace. To do so, follow the steps in this video or this documentation.
Generate an API key in the Credentials page of Cloud Console. You can follow the steps in this video or this documentation. All requests to Google Maps Platform require an API key. 

Now when you have an API key you can use it in GMapsApp struct and initialise GMSServices.
